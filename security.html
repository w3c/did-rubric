<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
    Security has a strong influence on overall trust in the ecosystem. Different DID methods offer different security guarantees, or guarantees of different strengths.

            A DID method that requires implementations to support something weak (e.g., 1024-bit RSA) is guaranteeing that its users will cooperate by default with encryption that's relatively easy to crack, with hashing that's not adequately collision-resistant, etc.

                Identifier entropy is directly derived from inception keys. Initial pre-rotation preserves this quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifiers are assigned by a VDR rather than chosen by users. The VDR uses a cryptographically robust RNG. This creates a chain of custody that's as strong as the VDR's integrity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifiers are related to inception keys with some caveats, or they are assigned by a VDR using an algorithm that has vulnerabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifiers are arbitrary. They have no chain of custody before they are registered on a VDR. DID squatting is possible.

                Rich diffuse control mechanisms are a first-class feature, and anyone who resolves a DID can see whether they are in use so confidence is increased. This may include device revocation (where keys must be exercised on a particular device to be valid).
            </li>
            <li>
                Some diffuse control is possible but has important deficits in documentation, maturity, or visibility.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiple parties can exercise control independently. Diffuse control is possible outside the system (e.g., using Shamir secret sharing to reconstitute a single key before updating a DID document). It's not possible to know whether such mechanisms are in use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only a single party can exercise control at a time.

            Diffuse trust makes hacking harder and recovery more robust (but maybe more complex).

            Does the system use cryptographic mechanisms that satisfy legal requirements in relevant jurisdictions (e.g., FIPS-certified algorithms, requirements for encryption back doors, etc).
