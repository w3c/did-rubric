    <p>
      The communities behind Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) bring together a
      diverse group of contributors who have decidedly different notions of exactly
      what "decentralization" means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than attempting to resolve this potentially unresolvable question, we
      propose a rubric &mdash; a scoring guide used to evaluate performance, a
      product, or a project &mdash; that teaches how to evaluate a given DID Method
      according to one's own requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rubric presents a set of criteria which an <a>Evaluator</a> can apply to
      any DID Method based on the use cases most relevant to them. We avoid reducing
      the Evaluation to a single number because the criteria tend to be multidimensional
      and many of the possible responses are not necessarily good or bad. It is up
      to the <a>Evaluator</a> to understand how each response in each criteria might
      illuminate favorable or unfavorable consequences for their needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rubric is a collection of criteria for creating Evaluation
      Reports that assist people in choosing a DID Method. 

      While this rubric assists in the evaluation of many aspects of a
      DID Method, it is not exhaustive.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        A rubric is a tool used in academia to communicate expectations and evaluate
        performance. It consists of a set of criteria to be evaluated, possible
        responses for each criteria, and a scoring guide explaining both how to
        choose and interpret each response. The act of evaluating a rubric, which we
        call an Evaluation, provides basis for self-evaluation, procurement decisions,
        or even marketing points. Written records of
        an evaluation, which we'll call an <a>Evaluation Report</a>, document how a
        particular subject is measured against the criteria. For students, a rubric
        helps to clarify how their work will be evaluated by others. For
        <a>Evaluator</a>s, a rubric provides a consistent framework for investigating
        and documenting the performance of a subject against a particular set of
        criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were inspired to develop a rubric for
        decentralization when discussions about the requirements for decentralized
        identifiers, aka DIDs, led to intractable disagreement. It became clear that
        no single definition of "decentralized" would suffice for all of the
        motivations that inspired developers of DID Methods to work on a new
        decentralized approach to identity. Despite this challenge, two facts remained
        clear:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the people invested in this work shared a common goal of reversing the
          problems with centralized identity systems and
        </li>
        <li>
          they also had numerous, distinct reasons for doing so.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Rather than attempt to force a definition of "decentralized" that might work
        for many but would alienate others, the group set out to capture the
        measurable factors that could enable <a>Evaluator</a>s to judge the
        decentralization of DID Methods based on their own independent requirements,
        with minimal embedded bias.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- background -->

    <section>
      <h3>How to apply this rubric</h3>
      <p>
        Pick the most important criteria for your use, ask each question, and select the
        most appropriate response. Do this for all of the DID
        Methods under consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>Evaluation</a> should start with an explicit framing of the use under
        consideration. Are you evaluating the Method for use in Internet-of-Things
        (IoT)? For school childrens' extra-curricular activities? For international
        travel? The use, or set of uses, will directly affect how some of the
        questions are answered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a given Method offers variability, such as multiple networks for the
        same Method, then evaluate each variant. For example, did:ethr supports
        Ethereum mainnet, multiple testnets and permissioned EVM-compliant networks
        such as Quorum. To apply a criteria to did:ethr, you will evaluate it against
        all the variations that matter <em>to you</em>. Each variation should get its
        own <a>Evaluation</a>. This applies to Level 2 Networks that can operate on
        multiple Level 1 Networks as well as DID Methods that directly offer support
        for multiple underlying DID registries.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating an <a>Evaluation Report</a>, we recommend noting both the
        <a>Evaluator</a> and the date of the <a>Evaluation</a>. Many of the criteria
        are subjective and all of them may evolve. Tracking who
        made the <a>Evaluation</a> and when they made it will help readers better
        understand any biases or timeliness issues that may affect the applicability
        of the <a>Evaluation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be selective and acknowledge the subjective. <a>Evaluations</a> do not need to
        be exhaustive. There is no requirement to answer all the questions. Simply
        answer the ones most relevant to the use contemplated. Similarly, understand
        that any recorded <a>Evaluation</a> is going to represent the biases of the
        <a>Evaluator</a> in the context of their target use. Even the same
        <a>Evaluator</a>, evaluating the same Method for a different use, may come up
        with slightly different answers&mdash;for example, that which is economically
        accessible for small businesses might not be cost-effective for refugees, and
        that could affect how well-suited a given Method is for a specific use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, note that this particular rubric is about decentralization. It
        doesn't cover all of the other criteria that might be relevant to evaluating a
        given DID Method. There are security, privacy, and economic concerns that
        should be considered. We look forward to working with the community to develop
        additional rubrics for these other areas and encourage <a>Evaluator</a>s to
        use this rubric as a starting point for their own work rather than the final
        say in the merit of any given Method.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, use this rubric to help understand if a given DID Method is
        decentralized enough for your needs.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Evaluation reports</h3>
      <p>
        To record and report an <a>Evaluation</a>, we recommend two possible formats,
        either comprehensive or comparative.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comprehensive <a>Evaluation</a> applies a single set of criteria to just one
        Method. This set is chosen by the <a>Evaluator</a>; it need not be all
        possible criteria, but it is all relevant criteria as judged by the
        <a>Evaluator</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comparative <a>Evaluation</a> includes multiple Methods in the same table to
        easily compare and contrast two or more different Methods. This may include
        any number of criteria. These are the type of reports we use as examples
        throughout the criteria list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the selected criteria, we recommend each report specify
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Method(s) being evaluated
        </li>
        <li>
          A link to the Method specification
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a>Evaluator</a>(s)
        </li>
        <li>
          The date of the <a>Evaluation</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          A description of the use case(s) for which the Method is being evaluated
        </li>
        <li>
          The rubric used for the <a>Evaluation</a>, along with reference to the
          specific version.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, a URL for retrieving the report.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section> <!-- evaluation -->

    <section>
      <h3>Categories of criteria</h3>
      <p>
        We have grouped our criteria into several categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Rulemaking
        </li>
        <li>
          Design
        </li>
        <li>
          Operations
        </li>
        <li>
          Enforcement
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternatives
        </li>
        <li>
          Adoption & Diversity
        </li>
        <li>
          Security
        </li>
        <li>
          Privacy</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <a>Evaluator</a>s should consider criteria from all groups, as best fits
        your use cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three categories cover how a given Method is governed:
        Rulemaking, Operations, and Enforcement.
        Our approach parallels the same separation of
        authority embodied in the United States Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rulemaking</strong> addresses who makes the rules and how. (This is
        the legislative branch in the US.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Operations</strong> addresses how those rules are executed and how
        everyone knows that they are carried out. (This is the executive branch in the
        US.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforcement</strong> addresses how we find and respond to rule
        breaking. (This is the judicial branch in the US.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This mental model is key to understanding the criteria of each section as well
        as why we included some criteria and not others.
      </p>
      <p>The remaining categories each covers different areas worth considering
        when evaluating DID Methods.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design</strong> addresses the method <em>as designed</em>. In other words, the output of the rulemaking:
        what rules apply
        to this DID method?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Alternatives</strong> address the availability and quality
        of different implementation choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Adoption & Diversity</strong> covers questions related to how widely a
        DID Method is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Security</strong> influences overall trust in the
        ecosystem. Different DID methods offer different security guarantees, or guarantees of different strengths.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Privacy</strong> addresses the ability of a DID method to
        ensure various privacy mechanisms. When DIDs are used as
        identifiers for people, it becomes important to consider what
        tools a DID method offers to operate at different levels
        of privacy.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- categories -->

    <section>
      <h3>The architecture</h3>
      <p>
        ​When evaluating the governance of DID Methods, three potentially independent
        layers should be considered: the specification, the network, and the registry.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>specification</strong> is the governing document for the Method
          that outlines how that particular Method implements the required and any
          optional components of the DID Core specification [[DID-CORE]].
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>network</strong> is the underlying communications layer, i.e., how
          users of the Method communicate with others to invoke the operations of the
          Method.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>registry</strong> is a given instance of recorded state changes,
          managed according to the specification, using the communications channel.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For Rulemaking, the criteria should be evaluated against all three of the
        above layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Operations, the criteria should be evaluated against the network and the
        registry. The specification is taken as a given (it is the core output of
        Rulemaking).
      </p>
      <p>
        For Adoption, the criteria should be evaluated for each major software
        component: wallet, resolver, and registry.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Alternatives, the criteria should be evaluated against the particular DID
        Method.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the examples in the rest of this document we refer to a set of Methods
        that are familiar to the authors and exhibit interesting characteristics for
        <a>Evaluation</a>. See the tables below.

      <h3>Criteria and Criterion</h3>
      <p>The term "criteria" is often treated as both a
        singular and a plural noun. In the singular, we say "The most
        important criteria is the buyer's age". This singular use of
        criteria has been in use for over half a century <a
          href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criterion#usage-1">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criterion#usage-1</a>
        In the plural we say "That proposal doesn't meet all of the
        criteria." Sometimes people use both in the same sentence: "Select
        one criteria from the list of criteria."
      </p>
      <p>However, for formal use, "criteria" is more broadly accepted as
        plural while "criterion" is singular. By this style rule, the last
        sentence in the previous paragraph <em>should</em> be "Select one
        criterion from the list of criteria." </p>
      <p>As editors of a Note published by the World Wide Web Consortium,
        we are torn. We would prefer to use 
        rigorous grammar and be consistent in doing so. At the same time,
        we find attempts to enforce the formal rule sometimes leads people
        to using the inverse, such as "Select a criteria from the list of
        criterion." This is the exact opposite of our desired outcome.</p>
      <p>In our own work with implementers and developers of the DID
        Core specification, we have found that the singular "criteria" is
        readily accepted and understood and leads to no confusion when
        used, even alongside plural usage. Since the DID Method Rubric
        is, at its core, a set of criteria with ample reason to refer to,
        for example, "Criteria #23", we find the combined singular and
        plural use is cleaner (just stick with "criteria"), less 
        confusing, and more aligned with common usage among our audience.</p>
      <p>As such, throughout the DID Method Rubric, we use the term
        "criteria" to refer to both singular instances of
        criteria and plural sets of criteria.</p>

    <h2>Registration Process</h2>
    This registry &mdash; the DID Method Rubric Registry &mdash; provides a public vehicle for publishing updated DID Method Rubric
    criteria. In order to add or update a criteria, a submitter MUST submit a modification request for this registry, as a
    pull request on the repository where this registry is hosted, where the modification request adheres to the following
    policies:</p>
    <section>
      <h3>General Requirements</h3>
      <ol>
      <li>If there are copyright, trademark, or intellectual property
      rights concerns, the addition and use MUST be authorized
      in writing by the intellectual property rights holder under a F/RAND 
      license. For example, criteria that use trademarked brand names, use the titles or excerpts from copyrighted works, or require patented technology to perform the evaluation.
      </li>
      <li>Additions MUST NOT create unreasonable legal, security, 
      moral, or privacy issues that may result in direct or
      indirect harm to others, including violations of the W3C Code Of
      Ethics And Professional Conduct <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">
      https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/</a>
      Examples of unacceptable additions include 
      any containing hate speech, unprofessional or
      unethical attacks, proprietary information, and any personal data or 
      personally identifiable information (excepting
      identification details of the submitter).
            </li>
      <li>All criteria MUST be uniquely identified and versioned to ensure
      permanent linkability with version trackability. Those
      identifiers MUST be present as an `href` anchor in the HTML for the 
      criteria itself. See the sections below on identifiers
      and versioning. Subcomponents, such as questions, responses, 
      relevance, and examples, are not separately versioned; any
      change to a subcomponent triggers an appropriate version change to 
      its primary component.
      </li>
      <li>Use cases, methods, and evaluations cited within a criteria MUST
      include a local link to a full citation in
      the relevant citation section: Use Cases Referenced,
      Methods Evaluated, and Evaluations Cited, respectively.
      </li>
      <li>Rubric criteria and associated metadata in the DID Method 
      Rubric Registry MAY be updated or removed at the editors’
      discretion, including the addition or removal of categories of 
      metadata such as <em>Use Cases Referenced</em> or <em>Implementations
      of Note</em>.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h3>Component Requirements</h3>
    <p>The primary components managed by this registry are criteria for 
    evaluating DID Methods, with as many as eight
    subcomponents: name, id, version, question, responses, relevance, 
    examples, and, optionally, a source. In addition, the
    DID Method Rubric maintains a list of cited references: DID methods, 
    use cases, and evaluations. The criteria are
    independently identified and versioned (see those sections for 
    details) while references cited in the criteria
    themselves link to their full citation in the appropriate list.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>Criteria</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Updates to criteria MUST follow the following versioning
        guidelines.
        </li>
        <li>Proposed criteria without at least three independent example 
        evaluations MUST have the word “PROVISIONAL” as the last
        term in its name. Once at least three independent example 
        evaluations exist, the word “PROVISIONAL” SHOULD be removed.
        </li>
        <li>Accepted (non-provisional) criteria MUST have at least three example evaluations, and generally SHOULD have no more example
        evaluations than there are possible responses to its question. Each example should distinctly illustrate one possible response to the
        criteria's question.
        </li>
        <li>To be considered, criteria MUST have the following subcomponents:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Name
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifier
            </li>
            <li>
              Version
            </li>
            <li>
              Question
            </li>
            <li>
              Possible Responses
            </li>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
        Additionally, criteria MAY have the following optional subcomponents:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Source
            </li>

        </ol>
      </section> <!-- criteria -->
      <section>
        <h4>Criteria.Name</h4>
        <p>Each criteria needs a human-friendly, short, descriptive name

</p>
      </section> <!-- Criteria.Id -->
      <section>
        <h4>Criteria.Version</h4>
        <p>The criteria version must increment, as appropriate, any time 
        the criteria, or any of its subcomponents, is updated. See
        the section on <a href="#versioning">Versioning</a> for details.</p>
      </section> <!-- Criteria.Version -->
      <section>
        <h4>Criteria.Question</h4>
        <p>This subcomponent presents the key question for evaluating the 
        criteria. The question MUST be a single inquiry that gets to
        the heart of the criteria. It should be reasonably clear to a 
        competent professional skilled in the art how to resolve
        the question into one of the possible responses.</p>
      </section> <!-- Criteria.Question -->

        <h4>Criteria.Responses</h4>
        <p>This subcomponent lists the expected responses to the question.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        Responses are either labeled or open ended.
        </li>
        <li>
        Labeled responses MUST include a label and a meaning for that 
        label.
        </li>
        <li>
        Labels for a response MUST start with “A” in each criteria and progress sequentially through the English alphabet.
        </li>
        <li>
        Open ended responses specify how an evaluator should fill in the response.
        </li>

      </section> <!-- Criteria.Responses -->
      <section>
        <h4>Criteria.Relevance</h4>
        <p>This subcomponent explains why this criteria is useful. Readers 
        should be able to understand the extent to which this
        particular criteria is applicable to their situation. 
        </p>
      </section> <!-- Criteria.Relevance -->
      <section>
        <h4>Criteria.Examples</h4>
        <p>This section lists example evaluations of different DID methods 
        using this criteria, presented as a table for easy
        correlation between evaluations of different methods using the 
        same criteria.
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Each example must have the following entries, each as its own column(s) in the examples table.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Method</li>
          <li>Responses (on column for each element)</li>
          <li>Notes</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
        Some criteria MAY require an additional "Referent" entry, in its
        own column in the examples table.
        </li>
        <li>Example Evaluations for a given criteria SHOULD highlight 
        distinct responses. That is, each evaluation should have a
        different set of responses from the other example evaluations. 
        The point of the examples is to illustrate how different
        DID methods score differently.</li>
        <li>The editors will curate the list of proposed examples to 
        provide a best effort illustration of each criteria, with
        consideration to highlighting a broad corpus of methods.</li>
        <li>Criteria with fewer than 3 example evaluations MUST be 
        marked “PROVISIONAL”</li>
        <li>Criteria SHOULD have no more example evaluations than there 
        are possible responses.</li>
        </ol>
        <section>
          <h4>Criteria.Examples.Method</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Example evaluations MUST specify the evaluated method in 
            the first column, using a relative link to the method’s entry
            in the Methods Evaluated section. The entry in the Methods 
            Evaluated table MUST conform to the requirements in that
            section. 
            </li>
            <li>The title of this column MUST be “Method”.
            </li>
            <li>The Method entry MUST uniquely identify a specific 
            DID Method specification suitable for evaluation,

            manner, a first criteria can elicit structural elements to
            be separately evaluated in subsequent criteria. This 
            “structure-variable” pattern allows the Rubric to support 
            criteria that matches the structural complexity of the 
            Method in question.

            <li>Example evaluations MUST include at least one response, 
            and may include multiple columns when appropriate. Each 
            column allows for responses to particular system elements 
            such as “Specification”, “Network”, and “Registry”.

            moves from PROVISIONAL to accepted.
            </li>
            <li>Each column MUST contain an entry that communicates the

            <li>For improved comparability across different methods, 
            responses SHOULD be based on the possible responses listed

            <li>
            Responses MAY be a variant of the Possible Responses, to 
            capture a nuance beyond those listed. For example, one might
            append a “+” or a “-”, e.g., A+, or even provide two 
            different responses when different situations merit a 
            distinction, e.g., A/D. The reasoning behind these variants 
            &nbps;
            SHOULD be explained in the Notes column.

        external source of the criteria, if any, by referring to its 
        entry in the Rubric’s list of Sources Cited. Source entries 
        should include both the name (or title) of the source as well as 
        a URL. When possible, sources should specify the precise page, 
        section, and/or anchor that points to the specific criteria
        in the source document. Each source listed in the criteria MUST 
        also be listed in the Sources Cited section.

      <h3>Identifiers</h3>
      <p>Each criteria must be explicitly, uniquely, and persistently
       identified using incremental numbers. New criteria should
      use the next available increment based on the highest numbered 
      identifier in the current publication.</p>
      <p>Previous numbered identifiers MUST NOT be re-used, even if the 
      criteria so identified are no longer published; this
      maintains the persistent linkability of previously published 
      versions. Such “retired” criteria MAY be listed in a Prior
      Criteria section linking directly to the latest published Rubric 
      containing the retired criteria; this Prior Criteria
      section MUST also contain an anchor with the canonical id.</p>
      <p>The registry shall maintain an entry with the “next available”
      number. Additions should use the “next available”
      number to construct an identifier for the new criteria, and update 
      the “next available” entry at the same time. Editors
      will manage any sequencing errors when accepting PRs.</p>
      
      <p>Identifiers must be constructed by appending that numerical value 
      to the string “criteria-” and incorporated in the ID
      of the heading element for that criteria, which when placed in the 
      Rubric appears as something like (note the version in
      its own span after the permalink):
      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Example criteria numbering">
      &lt;h4 id="criteria-1"&gt;Open contribution (participation)&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;a href="#criteria-1"&gt;https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric#criteria-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;1.0.0&lt;/span&gt;
      </pre>
      This allows permanent links to citations based on the publication 
      date of a given Rubric:
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/#criteria-32">https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/#criteria-32</a> as well as version-free links that resolve to the
      latest version of the criteria, and if retired, to an entry in the 
      Prior Criteria list which itself links to the last
      valid presentation of the criteria, so that, for example, <a 
      href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/#criteria-32">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/#criteria-32</a> points to the
      current criteria-32 in the latest published document. When that 
      criteria is retired, that same URL points to the entry
      in the Prior Criteria list, which links to its last versioned 
      publication, e.g.,
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/#criteria-32">https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/#criteria-32</a>

      <h3 id="versioning" >Versioning</h3>
      <p>Criteria versions allow for incremental improvements while 
      retaining long-term referenceability.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Versions contain a Major, Minor, and Patch number, based on 
      SemVer 2.0
      </li>
      <li>Every new criteria has a version of 1.0.0, even if PROVISIONAL.
      </li>
      <li>Updates to criteria must increment the appropriate version 
      number based on the scope of change:
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>Major</strong> number MUST increment if, <em>and only if</em>, 
        the criteria is fundamentally changed in a way that invalidates 
        existing
        evaluations. This could be a material change to any subcomponent 
        of the criteria, including removing or changing
        Possible Responses.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Minor</strong> number MUST increment if, <em>and only 
        if</em>, new responses are added, without invalidating existing 
        responses. It’s understood that an evaluator of an existing 
        evaluation may desire to choose the new response if they were 
        evaluating the criteria anew; however, as long as prior evaluations
        remain valid, a Minor increment SHOULD be applied.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Patch</strong> number MUST increment if, <em>and only 
        if</em>, the change to the question is “editorial”, defined by
        clarifying the original intent of the criteria WITHOUT 
        invalidating existing evaluations.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
      As long as a given criteria is an evolution of essentially the same 
      consideration, it retains the original identifier,
      even as its version is updated throughout its lifetime.
      </li>
      <li>
      Criteria that address fundamentally different considerations MUST be assigned a new criteria number rather than
      iterating an existing version number.

      <h3>Metadata Tables</h3>
      The registry maintains several tables of metadata, which aggregate references cited in Criteria. Each table presents an internally referencable label, anchor tag, and the necessary details for the contents of each.
      <section>
        <h3>Evaluations Cited</h3>
        <p>Every example evaluation cited in the Notes entry in an evaluation MUST link to a proper citation in this section.</p>
        <p>This is not a comprehensive listing of DID Method Rubric evaluations. It is expected that such evaluations are developed and published elsewhere, in support of various methods and use cases. Only those evaluations cited as Example Evaluations in current criteria will be listed.</p> 
        <p>Entries in this section MUST include:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Evaluators</strong> The name and contact 
        information for the parties accepting responsibility for that 
        evaluation. It MAY include each evaluator’s affiliation at the 
        time of the evaluation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation Date</strong> The performance date of 
        the evaluation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Funding</strong> The source, if any, of funds 
        explicitly paid to perform the evaluation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use Cases</strong> One or more use cases listed 
        Use Cases Referenced section of this registry, using the label 
        from that section.
        <ol type="a">
        <li>The use case label MUST be delimited by square brackets.</ li>
        <li>The label text itself must be a hyperlink to the entry in

        “UC.1” links to “#useCase-1” in the current document.
        </li>
        </ol>
        </li>

        <h3>Use Cases Referenced</h3>
        <p>Every use case cited in the Notes entry in an evaluation MUST link to an entry in this section.</p>
        <p>A collection of the use cases referenced by different evaluations. This is not a comprehensive list (see the DID Use Cases and Requirements document for a more detailed discussion). Rather, it is an aggregation of all the use cases cited by example evaluations in current criteria.</p>

        <li>This section MUST list all use cases cited by any example 
        evaluation for current criteria.

        <li>Use cases must specify a label for use by citations within 
        the registry.
        </li>
        <li>The label must be of the form UC.x where “x” is a unique, 
        incremental number within the Use Cases Referenced section.
        </li>
        <li>Each use case must have an unique name and an illustrative 
        description of a value-creating use of DIDs.
        </li>
        <li>Use cases SHOULD identify unique contexts or situations 
        not covered by other use cases in the registry.

        <p>Every DID method cited in the Example Evaluations MUST link to a proper citation in this section.
        </p>
        <p>This is not a comprehensive list (see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">DID Specification Registries</a> for a current list of registered Methods). Rather, this section aggregates the methods used in example evaluations of current criteria for easy reference.</p>
        <p>Each entry in the
        table SHOULD contain the following:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>A label for the DID method within the registry
        </li>
        <li>An anchor tag so that the entry in the table can be linked by 
        fragment from example evaluations.
        </li>
        <li>
        Columns for the Specification, the Network, and the Registry (SNR) 
        evaluated with this label.
        </li>
        <li>
        In the case that all three SNR entries would be identical for 
        different rows in the same table, subsequent entries MAY refer to 
        the prior entry by Method (with link), along with a description of 
        the difference, in a single column spanning all three SNR columns.
        </li>
        <li>Each SNR entry should uniquely describe the component evaluated.
          <ol type="a">
            <li><strong>Specification</strong> identifies the DID Method 
            specification under evaluation, with a hyperlink to the 
            specification (at the time of the evaluation).</li>
            <li><strong>Network</strong> identifies the communications 
            mechanism through which DID operations (create, read, update,
            and deactivate) are communicated.</li>
            <li><strong>Registry</strong> should unambiguously identify the 
            state management substrate of the method’s Verifiable Data 
            Registry.</li>

<h3>Editorial Acceptance & Publication</h3>
<p>The Editors of the DID Method Rubric Registry MUST consider all of the 
policies above when reviewing additions to the registry and MUST reject 
registry entries if they violate any of the policies in this section. 
Entities registering additions can challenge rejections first with the W3C 
DID Working Group and then, if they are not satisfied with the outcome, 
with the W3C Staff. W3C Staff need not be consulted on changes to the DID 
Method Rubric Registry, but do have the final authority on registry 
contents. This is to ensure that W3C can adequately respond to time 
sensitive legal, privacy, security, moral, or other pressing concerns 
without putting an undue operational burden on W3C Staff.
</p>
<p>Submissions to the registry that meet all the criteria listed above 
will be considered for inclusion, however the editors retain the 
responsibility of curating the content to ensure the broadest 
applicability of the DID Method Rubric with the goal of enabling effective
evaluations of any DID Method for any legitimate use case.

            Governance determines how the rules of the underlying network are set and

            The underlying financial goals of DID Method creators may affect the
            centralization of their Method. If the goal of a Method is to enhance or
            support a certain group, then there may be centralization focused on that
            group and their interests. In the most centralized extreme, a Method may be
            created explicitly to establish a monopoly market that it can extract rent
            from. The opposite extreme is a Method created explicitly for the public good.

            Governance takes resources, which can limit the ability of interested parties
            to influence rulemaking. Generally, the more expensive it is to participate,
            the more governance centralizes to those parties most able to make the
            investment.

            Permissioned operation impacts the availability of the network to various
            participants, which can affect inclusivity with regard to underserved or
            vulnerable populations. Permissioned networks also expose the permission giver
            to legal or other attacks.

            The ability to communicate with different (ideally all) resolvers and
            registries significantly increases the applicability of a decentralized
            identity layer / usability of a given wallet. Vice versa, limited capability
            to work with other Methods and registries restrict usage.

            Different Methods enable different scopes in which a DID might be considered
            usable or valid. For example, peer DIDs are only usable between the two peers
            who share unique DIDs with each other; other parties are unable to resolve the
            DID, find the DID Document, or use its information to establish secure
            interactions. In contrast, BTCR records all DIDs on a public ledger, meaning
            that all DIDs are fundamentally accessible to any party who might receive the
            DID. Contextual DIDs are a middle ground that allow a set of parties to use
            DIDs, while those outside that group cannot meaningfully do so. Finally,
            central DIDs use the DID syntax and DID Documents to establish secure
            communications, but authority to use these DIDs resides with the central party,
            who may revoke that ability at their discretion.

            Similar to Governance, financial accountability reflects the integrity and
            sustainability of the DID registry. The more open, transparent, and accountable
            the system, the greater the confidence a DID controller may have that it will
            remain stable and operational, and therefore continue to provide service.

          <h5>Question</h5>
          <p>
            How much memory is required for DID resolution, without relying on authoritative
            intermediaries (e.g. blockchain explorer APIs)? We consider the amount of memory
            required to fully resolve a DID of the method, whether that memory is stored
            locally or processed ephemerally via communications.

            Whether or not one can resolve a DID directly on a resource-constrained device
            affects the granularity at which smaller devices can be part of the ecosystem.
            If small edge devices, such as a smart watch, smart speaker, or even a mobile
            phone, are incapable of directly resolving a DID of the DID Method, then the
            method will lead to cloud-based services like blockchain explorer APIs, which
            themselves become a point of centralization. Many find this option an
            acceptable engineering trade-off. Others would prefer solutions that allow
            even the smallest devices to be fully capable of resolving DIDs in an
            authoritative manner.

            Being able to create a DID in constrained situations enables certain types of
            decentralized applications that otherwise are not possible. On the edge, many
            devices rely on gateways to manage compute-, memory-, and bandwidth- intensive
            tasks. For example, while a smart lightbulb might use ZigBee or 6LowPAN, it
            will typically use a hub to connect to the Internet, even for access from
            devices within the local IP network. The more resources it takes for small
            devices to participate in registration, the greater the percentage of those
            that will need to rely on centralizing factors like hubs and gateways.

      <h3>Enforcement</h3>
      <p>
        The matter of enforcement may be interpreted at many levels.
        Enforcement criteria addresses how the system enforces its own
        rules as well as how jurisdictional governance applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In state-level governance, enforcement is an operational matter for the police
        and a judgmental matter for the courts. In other words, the police and the
        courts constitute the enforcement powers of governance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For distributed systems, especially those like Bitcoin and Ethereum,
        enforcement is a function of both social and technical functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical enforcement could include such notions as which cryptography is used
        to ensure proper authentication of transactions or the details of a consensus
        mechanism such as proof of work (POW) or proof of stake (POS). Should a given
        cryptographic technique prove to be compromised, that would affect the ability
        of the system to enforce its own rules, making the specific cryptography used
        by a given Method a significant factor in evaluating the suitability of a
        given Method. Further, understanding the decentralized nature of a given POW
        or POS mechanism requires an <a>Evaluation</a> of both the means for executing
        the mechanism as well as a profile of those parties who could potentially
        influence or even undermine that mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social enforcement mechanisms rely on community or institutions. For Methods
        that have explicit governing bodies, like did:sov, presumably enforcement is a
        matter under their jurisdiction. Nodes on the network that operate outside the
        guidelines of the governing bodies can presumably have permission revoked as a
        means of enforcement. Methods that do not have formal governing bodies may,
        nevertheless, have a strong enough community to correct violations, as Ethereum
        did in response to the
        <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists">DAO hack</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, all Methods operate in (and across) one or more geographic
        jurisdictions, each with potentially distinct laws and mechanisms of
        enforcement. Identifying the potential enforcement mechanisms that
        <em>could</em> apply to the Method, to those using a Method, or to the
        operators of a Method, is almost certainly going to be relevant to certain
        <a>Evaluator</a>s. We have already seen GDPR and various US laws being applied
        based on where different servers are physically located, with lawsuits brought
        against server operators. It is inevitable that similar actions will eventually
        be brought against DID Method operators at various levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, understanding the process for identifying violations and enforcing
        the rules as set by the rulemakers is vital to a complete Evaluation of the
        decentralization of a DID Method. We regret that we were not able to sufficiently
        explore these issues for this rubric and we look forward to working with
        subsequent collaborators to flesh out criteria that can provide suitable
        guidance for enforcement criteria.

          <p>
            Trustlessness is a prerequisite of a decentralized system. If you have to
            trust the source of a DID Document (i.e., if you can't verify
            cryptographically a DID Document that is returned from resolution), then you
            are at the mercy of a potentially centralized authority. If, instead you have
            a cryptographic audit trail, then the current state of a DID cannot be
            compromised by an intermediary or central party.

            A DID method that requires implementations to support something weak (e.g.,
            1024-bit RSA) is guaranteeing that its users will cooperate by default with
            encryption that's relatively easy to crack, with hashing that's not adequately

                The DID method specific identifier for the IPID DID method is
                a hash of the public key of an IPFS node. Typically this is a
                SHA-256 value (256 bits of security), but other hashing
                algorithms can be plugged in. Ed25519 and RSA are the supported
                keytypes. Edwards keys are 256-bit but offer 128 bits of
                security; typical 2048-bit RSA offers 112 bits of security.
                Access to IPFS via a web service API such as ipfs.io/api uses
                TLS; spot-checking shows 2048-bit RSA certs.

                Although the DNS subsystem that supports did:web does not
                provide strong security, control of a DID is proved by
                accessing /.well-known over TLS. Thus, the security is tied
                to certificate config. Most web server certificates use 2048-
                bit RSA, which gives 112 bits of security.

                The IPFS ecosystem allows a user to use a different hash
                algorithm as a configuration choice. Since this algorithm
                is the basis of the CID, which is in turn the basis of the
                DID value, did:ipid can easily upgrade its DID values if a

              Identifiers are assigned by a VDR rather than chosen by users. The VDR uses
              a cryptographically robust RNG. This creates a chain of custody that's as
              strong as the VDR's integrity.

            <li>
              Identifiers are related to inception keys with some caveats, or they are

              Identifiers are arbitrary. They have no chain of custody before they are

                A Hyperledger Indy blockchain such as Sovrin MainNet returns
                state proofs that allow a reliable answer even if only a single
                node responds. It also separates network traffic related to
                clients from traffic related to inter-node consensus, with
                consensus occurring on a NIC that blacklists all IP addresses
                except other nodes. This significantly mitigates denial of service
                or service interruptions for reading. Writes are submitted to 1/3
                of the nodes in parallel, so attacks on individual nodes are
                unlikely to produce downtime. This behavior is validated with
                careful testing and has been demonstrated through four years of
                production usage with greater than 99% uptime. Sovrin adds to

              Every evolution of state is recorded, accessible, and linked appropriately
              to its predecessor. Arbitrary versions can be queried and proved correct,
              and they have a reasonably useful timestamp.

            <li>
              Adequate evidence of proper evolution exists, and a forensic analysis
              could prove correctness. However, it's not exposed for consumption of
              ordinary resolvers, it lacks supporting metadata, or it's exposed in
              a very suboptimal way.

            To what extent does the system support mechanisms where DID control

              Rich diffuse control mechanisms are a first-class feature, and anyone who
              resolves a DID can see whether they are in use so confidence is increased.
              This may include device revocation (where keys must be exercised on a
              particular device to be valid).
            </li>

              Some diffuse control is possible but has important deficits in

            <li>
              Multiple parties can exercise control independently. Diffuse control
              is possible outside the system (e.g., using Shamir secret sharing to
              reconstitute a single key before updating a DID document). It's not
              possible to know whether such mechanisms are in use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only a single party can exercise control at a time.

      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Addresses the ability of a DID method to ensure various privacy
        mechanisms. When DIDs are used as identifiers for people, it
        becomes important to consider what tools a DID method offers to
        operate at different levels of privacy. Use cases that focus on
        IoT or institutions may not feel that this dimension is especially
        important (though institutional privacy may sometimes be desirable).
      </p>

      <p>
        Privacy tends to surface some interesting tradeoffs. For example, DID
        methods that score very high in the "transparency" dimension may score
        low in privacy, and vice versa.

            Restricting the audience for a DID is a way to discourage crawling
            and secondary, possibly abusive publication. However, no mechanism
            can completely prevent this; creating disincentives, accountability,

              It may be possible to infer relationships of common control based on
              timing and the IP address of clients, but not based on data persisted
              in the VDR itself. Inference is expensive or impractical.

              The natural and default behavior is to create a new DID in each new
              context, and there is no meaningful incentive to do otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is possible to create and manage numerous DIDs, but the latency,
              complexity, or monetary expense of doing so results in modest
              pressure to reuse a DID.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each DID is expensive in at least one important dimension. Incentives to reuse are strong.

          <h5>Question</h5>
          <p>
            How does one revoke consent for the storage of a DID? (Note how this
            creates a tension with immutability, which may be valuable in 2.7.1
            and elsewhere.)

          <ol type="A">
            <li>
              The VDR fully supports removal of data that no longer has consent.
              Once something is removed, nothing internal to the system allows
              it to be recovered, and the system no longer qualifies as a
              data controller.
            </li>
            <li>
              The DID method only supports a current view, and the state of an
              identifier in its VDR can be updated to a deleted or removed state.
              Thus, the identifier ceases to resolve. However, a permanent record
              of the previous state of the identifier remains, and could be used
              to reconstruct historical data. The VDR thus remains a data
              controller for deleted identifiers, at least in concept.
            </li>
            <li>
              The DID method supports both current and previous views of an
              identifier. While deletes are possible, the old state of an identifier
              is a fully supported feature, so adding the identifier to the VDR is
              irrevocable.

                individuals. However, it persists data to an immutable blockchain,
                meaning that a deleted DID can be reconstructed outside the method,

        Addresses the ability of authors or users of a DID method to evaluate 
        possible environmental impacts of a specific DID method.

      <p>
        As with all criteria explored in this Rubric, comparative evaluation
        of environmental concerns may surface some interesting tradeoffs.
        For example, DID methods that score very high or very low (where
        low is desirable, and high is not) in environmental impact may have
        oppositely desirable scores in some other category. That is, when
        environmental impact is lowered, the other category rises, and when
        environmental impact is raised, the other category sinks. Only you
        can determine the appropriate balance of these tradeoffs for your
        deployment or development.
