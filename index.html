    <p>
      The communities behind Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) bring together a
      diverse group of contributors who have decidedly different notions of exactly
      what "decentralization" means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than attempting to resolve this potentially unresolvable question, we
      propose a rubric &mdash; a scoring guide used to evaluate performance, a
      product, or a project &mdash; that teaches how to evaluate a given DID Method
      according to one's own requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rubric presents a set of criteria which an <a>Evaluator</a> can apply to
      any DID Method based on the use cases most relevant to them. We avoid reducing
      the Evaluation to a single number because the criteria tend to be multidimensional
      and many of the possible responses are not necessarily good or bad. It is up
      to the <a>Evaluator</a> to understand how each response in each criteria might
      illuminate favorable or unfavorable consequences for their needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this rubric allows the evaluation of many aspects of decentralization of
      a DID Method, it is not exhaustive, and does not cover other factors that may
      affect selection or adoption of a particular Method, such as privacy, security,
      reliability, or efficiency.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        A rubric is a tool used in academia to communicate expectations and evaluate
        performance. It consists of a set of criteria to be evaluated, possible
        responses for each criteria, and a scoring guide explaining both how to
        choose and interpret each response. The act of evaluating a rubric, which we
        call an Evaluation, provides basis for self-evaluation, procurement decisions,
        or even marketing points. Written records of
        an evaluation, which we'll call an <a>Evaluation Report</a>, document how a
        particular subject is measured against the criteria. For students, a rubric
        helps to clarify how their work will be evaluated by others. For
        <a>Evaluator</a>s, a rubric provides a consistent framework for investigating
        and documenting the performance of a subject against a particular set of
        criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were inspired to develop a rubric for
        decentralization when discussions about the requirements for decentralized
        identifiers, aka DIDs, led to intractable disagreement. It became clear that
        no single definition of "decentralized" would suffice for all of the
        motivations that inspired developers of DID Methods to work on a new
        decentralized approach to identity. Despite this challenge, two facts remained
        clear:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the people invested in this work shared a common goal of reversing the
          problems with centralized identity systems and
        </li>
        <li>
          they also had numerous, distinct reasons for doing so.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Rather than attempt to force a definition of "decentralized" that might work
        for many but would alienate others, the group set out to capture the
        measurable factors that could enable <a>Evaluator</a>s to judge the
        decentralization of DID Methods based on their own independent requirements,
        with minimal embedded bias.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- background -->

    <section>
      <h3>How to apply this rubric</h3>
      <p>
        Pick the most important criteria for your use, ask each question, and select the
        most appropriate response. Do this for all of the DID
        Methods under consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>Evaluation</a> should start with an explicit framing of the use under
        consideration. Are you evaluating the Method for use in Internet-of-Things
        (IoT)? For school childrens' extra-curricular activities? For international
        travel? The use, or set of uses, will directly affect how some of the
        questions are answered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a given Method offers variability, such as multiple networks for the
        same Method, then evaluate each variant. For example, did:ethr supports
        Ethereum mainnet, multiple testnets and permissioned EVM-compliant networks
        such as Quorum. To apply a criteria to did:ethr, you will evaluate it against
        all the variations that matter <em>to you</em>. Each variation should get its
        own <a>Evaluation</a>. This applies to Level 2 Networks that can operate on
        multiple Level 1 Networks as well as DID Methods that directly offer support
        for multiple underlying DID registries.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating an <a>Evaluation Report</a>, we recommend noting both the
        <a>Evaluator</a> and the date of the <a>Evaluation</a>. Many of the criteria
        are subjective and all of them may evolve. Tracking who
        made the <a>Evaluation</a> and when they made it will help readers better
        understand any biases or timeliness issues that may affect the applicability
        of the <a>Evaluation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be selective and acknowledge the subjective. <a>Evaluations</a> do not need to
        be exhaustive. There is no requirement to answer all the questions. Simply
        answer the ones most relevant to the use contemplated. Similarly, understand
        that any recorded <a>Evaluation</a> is going to represent the biases of the
        <a>Evaluator</a> in the context of their target use. Even the same
        <a>Evaluator</a>, evaluating the same Method for a different use, may come up
        with slightly different answers&mdash;for example, that which is economically
        accessible for small businesses might not be cost-effective for refugees, and
        that could affect how well-suited a given Method is for a specific use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, note that this particular rubric is about decentralization. It
        doesn't cover all of the other criteria that might be relevant to evaluating a
        given DID Method. There are security, privacy, and economic concerns that
        should be considered. We look forward to working with the community to develop
        additional rubrics for these other areas and encourage <a>Evaluator</a>s to
        use this rubric as a starting point for their own work rather than the final
        say in the merit of any given Method.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, use this rubric to help understand if a given DID Method is
        decentralized enough for your needs.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Evaluation reports</h3>
      <p>
        To record and report an <a>Evaluation</a>, we recommend two possible formats,
        either comprehensive or comparative.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comprehensive <a>Evaluation</a> applies a single set of criteria to just one
        Method. This set is chosen by the <a>Evaluator</a>; it need not be all
        possible criteria, but it is all relevant criteria as judged by the
        <a>Evaluator</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comparative <a>Evaluation</a> includes multiple Methods in the same table to
        easily compare and contrast two or more different Methods. This may include
        any number of criteria. These are the type of reports we use as examples
        throughout the criteria list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the selected criteria, we recommend each report specify
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Method(s) being evaluated
        </li>
        <li>
          A link to the Method specification
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a>Evaluator</a>(s)
        </li>
        <li>
          The date of the <a>Evaluation</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          A description of the use case(s) for which the Method is being evaluated
        </li>
        <li>
          The rubric used for the <a>Evaluation</a>, along with reference to the
          specific version.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, a URL for retrieving the report.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section> <!-- evaluation -->

    <section>
      <h3>Categories of criteria</h3>
      <p>
        We have grouped our criteria into several categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Rulemaking
        </li>
        <li>
          Design
        </li>
        <li>
          Operations
        </li>
        <li>
          Enforcement
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternatives
        </li>
        <li>
          Adoption & Diversity
        </li>
        <li>
          Security
        </li>
        <li>
          Privacy</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <a>Evaluator</a>s should consider criteria from all groups, as best fits
        your use cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three categories cover how a given Method is governed:
        Rulemaking, Operations, and Enforcement.
        Our approach parallels the same separation of
        authority embodied in the United States Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rulemaking</strong> addresses who makes the rules and how. (This is
        the legislative branch in the US.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Operations</strong> addresses how those rules are executed and how
        everyone knows that they are carried out. (This is the executive branch in the
        US.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforcement</strong> addresses how we find and respond to rule
        breaking. (This is the judicial branch in the US.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This mental model is key to understanding the criteria of each section as well
        as why we included some criteria and not others.
      </p>
      <p>The remaining categories each covers different areas worth considering
        when evaluating DID Methods.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Design</strong> addresses the method <em>as designed</em>. In other words, the output of the rulemaking:
        what rules apply
        to this DID method?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Alternatives</strong> address the availability and quality
        of different implementation choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Adoption & Diversity</strong> covers questions related to how widely a
        DID Method is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Security</strong> influences overall trust in the
        ecosystem. Different DID methods offer different security guarantees, or guarantees of different strengths.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Privacy</strong> addresses the ability of a DID method to
        ensure various privacy mechanisms. When DIDs are used as
        identifiers for people, it becomes important to consider what
        tools a DID method offers to operate at different levels
        of privacy.
      </p>
    </section> <!-- categories -->

    <section>
      <h3>The architecture</h3>
      <p>
        ​When evaluating the governance of DID Methods, three potentially independent
        layers should be considered: the specification, the network, and the registry.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>specification</strong> is the governing document for the Method
          that outlines how that particular Method implements the required and any
          optional components of the DID Core specification [[DID-CORE]].
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>network</strong> is the underlying communications layer, i.e., how
          users of the Method communicate with others to invoke the operations of the
          Method.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>registry</strong> is a given instance of recorded state changes,
          managed according to the specification, using the communications channel.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For Rulemaking, the criteria should be evaluated against all three of the
        above layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Operations, the criteria should be evaluated against the network and the
        registry. The specification is taken as a given (it is the core output of
        Rulemaking).
      </p>
      <p>
        For Adoption, the criteria should be evaluated for each major software
        component: wallet, resolver, and registry.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Alternatives, the criteria should be evaluated against the particular DID
        Method.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the examples in the rest of this document we refer to a set of Methods
        that are familiar to the authors and exhibit interesting characteristics for
        <a>Evaluation</a>. See the tables below.

      <h3>Criteria and Criterion</h3>
      <p>The term "criteria" is often treated as both a
        singular and a plural noun. In the singular, we say "The most
        important criteria is the buyer's age". This singular use of
        criteria has been in use for over half a century <a
          href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criterion#usage-1">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criterion#usage-1</a>
        In the plural we say "That proposal doesn't meet all of the
        criteria." Sometimes people use both in the same sentence: "Select
        one criteria from the list of criteria."
      </p>
      <p>However, for formal use, "criteria" is more broadly accepted as
        plural while "criterion" is singular. By this style rule, the last
        sentence in the previous paragraph <em>should</em> be "Select one
        criterion from the list of criteria." </p>
      <p>As editors of a Note published by the World Wide Web Consortium,
        we are torn. We would prefer to use 
        rigorous grammar and be consistent in doing so. At the same time,
        we find attempts to enforce the formal rule sometimes leads people
        to using the inverse, such as "Select a criteria from the list of
        criterion." This is the exact opposite of our desired outcome.</p>
      <p>In our own work with implementers and developers of the DID
        Core specification, we have found that the singular "criteria" is
        readily accepted and understood and leads to no confusion when
        used, even alongside plural usage. Since the DID Method Rubric
        is, at its core, a set of criteria with ample reason to refer to,
        for example, "Criteria #23", we find the combined singular and
        plural use is cleaner (just stick with "criteria"), less 
        confusing, and more aligned with common usage among our audience.</p>
      <p>As such, throughout the DID Method Rubric, we use the term
        "criteria" to refer to both singular instances of
        criteria and plural sets of criteria.</p>

          <h5>Relevance</h5>
          <p>
            Governance determines how the rules of the underlying network are set and
            maintained. The more parties that are able to contribute to governance debates,
            the more decentralized the governance.

            While participation measures active contribution, transparency measures the
            visibility of discussions affecting rule making. If such discussions are only
            visible to a limited group, it centralizes decision making in ways that
            <a>Evaluators</a> and users cannot easily see.

            The underlying financial goals of DID Method creators may affect the
            centralization of their Method. If the goal of a Method is to enhance or
            support a certain group, then there may be centralization focused on that
            group and their interests. In the most centralized extreme, a Method may be
            created explicitly to establish a monopoly market that it can extract rent
            from. The opposite extreme is a Method created explicitly for the public good.

            Governance takes resources, which can limit the ability of interested parties
            to influence rulemaking. Generally, the more expensive it is to participate,
            the more governance centralizes to those parties most able to make the
            investment.

            Permissioned operation impacts the availability of the network to various
            participants, which can affect inclusivity with regard to underserved or

            Does the DID Method restrict access or functionality to particular wallet
            implementations per the specification? (Whether or not any given wallet works
            with the resolver or registry is covered elsewhere.)

            The ability to communicate with different (ideally all) resolvers and
            registries significantly increases the applicability of a decentralized
            identity layer / usability of a given wallet. Vice versa, limited capability
            to work with other Methods and registries restrict usage.

            Different Methods enable different scopes in which a DID might be considered
            usable or valid. For example, peer DIDs are only usable between the two peers
            who share unique DIDs with each other; other parties are unable to resolve the
            DID, find the DID Document, or use its information to establish secure
            interactions. In contrast, BTCR records all DIDs on a public ledger, meaning
            that all DIDs are fundamentally accessible to any party who might receive the
            DID. Contextual DIDs are a middle ground that allow a set of parties to use
            DIDs, while those outside that group cannot meaningfully do so. Finally,
            central DIDs use the DID syntax and DID Documents to establish secure
            communications, but authority to use these DIDs resides with the central party,
            who may revoke that ability at their discretion.

                of the DID can actually use it. The DIDs have no use outside that direct
                peer-to-peer relationship.

            Similar to Governance, financial accountability reflects the integrity and
            sustainability of the DID registry. The more open, transparent, and accountable
            the system, the greater the confidence a DID controller may have that it will
            remain stable and operational, and therefore continue to provide service.

          <h5>Question</h5>
          <p>
            How much memory is required for DID resolution, without relying on authoritative
            intermediaries (e.g. blockchain explorer APIs)? We consider the amount of memory
            required to fully resolve a DID of the method, whether that memory is stored
            locally or processed ephemerally via communications.

            Whether or not one can resolve a DID directly on a resource-constrained device
            affects the granularity at which smaller devices can be part of the ecosystem.
            If small edge devices, such as a smart watch, smart speaker, or even a mobile
            phone, are incapable of directly resolving a DID of the DID Method, then the
            method will lead to cloud-based services like blockchain explorer APIs, which
            themselves become a point of centralization. Many find this option an
            acceptable engineering trade-off. Others would prefer solutions that allow
            even the smallest devices to be fully capable of resolving DIDs in an
            authoritative manner.

            Being able to create a DID in constrained situations enables certain types of
            decentralized applications that otherwise are not possible. On the edge, many
            devices rely on gateways to manage compute-, memory-, and bandwidth- intensive
            tasks. For example, while a smart lightbulb might use ZigBee or 6LowPAN, it
            will typically use a hub to connect to the Internet, even for access from
            devices within the local IP network. The more resources it takes for small
            devices to participate in registration, the greater the percentage of those
            that will need to rely on centralizing factors like hubs and gateways.

      <h3>Enforcement</h3>
      <p>
        The matter of enforcement may be interpreted at many levels.
        Enforcement criteria addresses how the system enforces its own
        rules as well as how jurisdictional governance applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In state-level governance, enforcement is an operational matter for the police
        and a judgmental matter for the courts. In other words, the police and the
        courts constitute the enforcement powers of governance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For distributed systems, especially those like Bitcoin and Ethereum,
        enforcement is a function of both social and technical functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical enforcement could include such notions as which cryptography is used
        to ensure proper authentication of transactions or the details of a consensus
        mechanism such as proof of work (POW) or proof of stake (POS). Should a given
        cryptographic technique prove to be compromised, that would affect the ability
        of the system to enforce its own rules, making the specific cryptography used
        by a given Method a significant factor in evaluating the suitability of a
        given Method. Further, understanding the decentralized nature of a given POW
        or POS mechanism requires an <a>Evaluation</a> of both the means for executing
        the mechanism as well as a profile of those parties who could potentially
        influence or even undermine that mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social enforcement mechanisms rely on community or institutions. For Methods
        that have explicit governing bodies, like did:sov, presumably enforcement is a
        matter under their jurisdiction. Nodes on the network that operate outside the
        guidelines of the governing bodies can presumably have permission revoked as a
        means of enforcement. Methods that do not have formal governing bodies may,
        nevertheless, have a strong enough community to correct violations, as Ethereum
        did in response to the
        <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists">DAO hack</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, all Methods operate in (and across) one or more geographic
        jurisdictions, each with potentially distinct laws and mechanisms of
        enforcement. Identifying the potential enforcement mechanisms that
        <em>could</em> apply to the Method, to those using a Method, or to the
        operators of a Method, is almost certainly going to be relevant to certain
        <a>Evaluator</a>s. We have already seen GDPR and various US laws being applied
        based on where different servers are physically located, with lawsuits brought
        against server operators. It is inevitable that similar actions will eventually
        be brought against DID Method operators at various levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, understanding the process for identifying violations and enforcing
        the rules as set by the rulemakers is vital to a complete Evaluation of the
        decentralization of a DID Method. We regret that we were not able to sufficiently
        explore these issues for this rubric and we look forward to working with
        subsequent collaborators to flesh out criteria that can provide suitable
        guidance for enforcement criteria.

            Trustlessness is a prerequisite of a decentralized system. If you have to
            trust the source of a DID Document (i.e., if you can't verify
            cryptographically a DID Document that is returned from resolution), then you
            are at the mercy of a potentially centralized authority. If, instead you have
            a cryptographic audit trail, then the current state of a DID cannot be
            compromised by an intermediary or central party.

            A DID method that requires implementations to support something weak (e.g.,
            1024-bit RSA) is guaranteeing that its users will cooperate by default with
            encryption that's relatively easy to crack, with hashing that's not adequately
            collision-resistant, etc. See

                algorithms can be plugged in. Ed25519 and RSA are the supported

                Access to IPFS via a web service API such as ipfs.io/api uses

                Although the DNS subsystem that supports did:web does not

                accessing /.well-known over TLS. Thus, the security is tied
                to certificate config. Most web server certificates use 2048-

                A Hyperledger Indy blockchain such as Sovrin MainNet returns
                state proofs that allow a reliable answer even if only a single
                node responds. It also separates network traffic related to
                clients from traffic related to inter-node consensus, with
                consensus occurring on a NIC that blacklists all IP addresses
                except other nodes. This significantly mitigates denial of service
                or service interruptions for reading. Writes are submitted to 1/3
                of the nodes in parallel, so attacks on individual nodes are
                unlikely to produce downtime. This behavior is validated with
                careful testing and has been demonstrated through four years of
                production usage with greater than 99% uptime. Sovrin adds to
                Indy's guarantees by publishing a

              Rich diffuse control mechanisms are a first-class feature, and anyone who
              resolves a DID can see whether they are in use so confidence is increased.
              This may include device revocation (where keys must be exercised on a
              particular device to be valid).
            </li>
            <li>
              Some diffuse control is possible but has important deficits in

            <li>
              Multiple parties can exercise control independently. Diffuse control
              is possible outside the system (e.g., using Shamir secret sharing to
              reconstitute a single key before updating a DID document). It's not
              possible to know whether such mechanisms are in use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only a single party can exercise control at a time.

      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Addresses the ability of a DID method to ensure various privacy
        mechanisms. When DIDs are used as identifiers for people, it
        becomes important to consider what tools a DID method offers to
        operate at different levels of privacy. Use cases that focus on
        IoT or institutions may not feel that this dimension is especially
        important (though institutional privacy may sometimes be desirable).
      </p>

      <p>
        Privacy tends to surface some interesting tradeoffs. For example, DID
        methods that score very high in the "transparency" dimension may score
        low in privacy, and vice versa.

            Restricting the audience for a DID is a way to discourage crawling
            and secondary, possibly abusive publication. However, no mechanism
            can completely prevent this; creating disincentives, accountability,
            and/or costs that encourage the DID owner's wishes to be respected
            is the best we can hope for.

            a DID to be reused in multiple contexts?

              The natural and default behavior is to create a new DID in each new
              context, and there is no meaningful incentive to do otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is possible to create and manage numerous DIDs, but the latency,
              complexity, or monetary expense of doing so results in modest
              pressure to reuse a DID.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each DID is expensive in at least one important dimension. Incentives to reuse are strong.

            People will often trade away privacy for a low price or ease of use.
            Methods that encourage this tradeoff are less optimal from a privacy
            perspective, even if their privacy features are theoretically reasonable.

                At times when Bitcoin value has spiked, creating a DID on Bitcoin has
                required an expensive transaction. Finality also takes a significant
                amount of time. This creates incentives to reuse a DID in multiple
                contexts.

        <section>
          <h5>Question</h5>
          <p>
            How does one revoke consent for the storage of a DID? (Note how this
            creates a tension with immutability, which may be valuable in 2.7.1
            and elsewhere.)
          </p>

        <section>
          <h5>Responses</h5>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>
              The VDR fully supports removal of data that no longer has consent.
              Once something is removed, nothing internal to the system allows
              it to be recovered, and the system no longer qualifies as a
              data controller.
            </li>
            <li>
              The DID method only supports a current view, and the state of an
              identifier in its VDR can be updated to a deleted or removed state.
              Thus, the identifier ceases to resolve. However, a permanent record
              of the previous state of the identifier remains, and could be used
              to reconstruct historical data. The VDR thus remains a data
              controller for deleted identifiers, at least in concept.
            </li>
            <li>
              The DID method supports both current and previous views of an
              identifier. While deletes are possible, the old state of an identifier
              is a fully supported feature, so adding the identifier to the VDR is
              irrevocable.

            Some legal authorities may require that individuals have redress when
            they are not satisfied with the actions of a data controller. This might
            include but go beyond the so-called "right to be forgotten," encompassing
            geographical or jurisdictional limitations, limits on processing, and
            so forth. See

                A peer DID is designed to be shared only with the party that has
                direct need to process it. That party is a single legal entity
                that can be held responsible for their behavior. The peer DID
                protocol includes a way to tell that party that the DID must be
                deleted. Once deletion has occurred, nothing in the peer DID
                mechanism preserves inappropriate data.

                The `did:jlinc` method supports deletion, and refuses to resolve

                data-sharing agreements that can provide substantial protection for
                individuals. However, it persists data to an immutable blockchain,
                meaning that a deleted DID can be reconstructed outside the method,
                using data that the method created.
