      <p>
The communities behind Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) bring together a
diverse group of contributors who have decidedly different notions of exactly
what "decentralization" means.
      </p>
      <p>
Rather than attempting to resolve this potentially unresolvable question, we
propose a rubric &mdash; a scoring guide used to evaluate performance, a
product, or a project &mdash; that teaches how to evaluate a given DID Method
according to one's own requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
This rubric presents a set of criteria which an <a>Evaluator</a> can apply to
any DID Method based on the use cases most relevant to them. We avoid reducing
the Evaluation to a single number because the criteria tend to be multidimensional
and many of the possible responses are not necessarily good or bad. It is up
to the <a>Evaluator</a> to understand how each response in each criteria might
illuminate favorable or unfavorable consequences for their needs.
      </p>
      <p>
While this rubric allows the evaluation of many aspects of decentralization of
a DID Method, it is not exhaustive, and does not cover other factors that may
affect selection or adoption of a particular Method, such as privacy, security,
reliability, or efficiency.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
A rubric is a tool used in academia to communicate expectations and evaluate
performance. It consists of a set of criteria to be evaluated, possible
responses for each criterion, and a scoring guide explaining both how to
choose and interpret each response. The act of evaluating a rubric, which we
call an Evaluation, provides basis for self-evaluation, procurement decisions,
or even marketing points. Written records of
an evaluation, which we'll call an <a>Evaluation Report</a>, document how a
particular subject is measured against the criteria. For students, a rubric
helps to clarify how their work will be evaluated by others. For
<a>Evaluator</a>s, a rubric provides a consistent framework for investigating
and documenting the performance of a subject against a particular set of
criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
We were inspired to develop a rubric for
decentralization when discussions about the requirements for decentralized
identifiers, aka DIDs, led to intractable disagreement. It became clear that
no single definition of "decentralized" would suffice for all of the
motivations that inspired developers of DID Methods to work on a new
decentralized approach to identity. Despite this challenge, two facts remained
clear:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
the people invested in this work shared a common goal of reversing the
problems with centralized identity systems and
          </li>
          <li>
they also had numerous, distinct reasons for doing so.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
Rather than attempt to force a definition of "decentralized" that might work
for many but would alienate others, the group set out to capture the
measurable factors that could enable <a>Evaluator</a>s to judge the
decentralization of DID Methods based on their own independent requirements,
with minimal embedded bias.
        </p>
      </section> <!-- background -->

      <section>
        <h3>How to apply this rubric</h3>
        <p>
Pick the most important criteria for your use, ask each question, and select the
most appropriate response. Do this for all of the DID
Methods under consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
Each <a>Evaluation</a> should start with an explicit framing of the use under
consideration. Are you evaluating the Method for use in Internet-of-Things
(IoT)? For school childrens' extra-curricular activities? For international
travel? The use, or set of uses, will directly affect how some of the
questions are answered.
        </p>
        <p>
Where a given Method offers variability, such as multiple networks for the
same Method, then evaluate each variant. For example, did:ethr supports
Ethereum mainnet, multiple testnets and permissioned EVM-compliant networks
such as Quorum. To apply a criterion to did:ethr, you will evaluate it against
all the variations that matter <em>to you</em>. Each variation should get its
own <a>Evaluation</a>. This applies to Level 2 Networks that can operate on
multiple Level 1 Networks as well as DID Methods that directly offer support
for multiple underlying DID registries.
        </p>
        <p>
When creating an <a>Evaluation Report</a>, we recommend noting both the
<a>Evaluator</a> and the date of the <a>Evaluation</a>. Many of the criteria
are subjective and all of them may evolve. Tracking who
made the <a>Evaluation</a> and when they made it will help readers better
understand any biases or timeliness issues that may affect the applicability
of the <a>Evaluation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Be selective and acknowledge the subjective. <a>Evaluations</a> do not need to
be exhaustive. There is no requirement to answer all the questions. Simply
answer the ones most relevant to the use contemplated.  Similarly, understand
that any recorded <a>Evaluation</a> is going to represent the biases of the
<a>Evaluator</a> in the context of their target use. Even the same
<a>Evaluator</a>, evaluating the same Method for a different use, may come up
with slightly different answers&mdash;for example, that which is economically
accessible for small businesses might not be cost-effective for refugees, and
that could affect how well-suited a given Method is for a specific use.
        </p>
        <p>
Finally, note that this particular rubric is about decentralization. It
doesn't cover all of the other criteria that might be relevant to evaluating a
given DID Method. There are security, privacy, and economic concerns that
should be considered. We look forward to working with the community to develop
additional rubrics for these other areas and encourage <a>Evaluator</a>s to
use this rubric as a starting point for their own work rather than the final
say in the merit of any given Method.
        </p>
        <p>
In short, use this rubric to help understand if a given DID Method is
decentralized enough for your needs.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Evaluation reports</h3>
        <p>
To record and report an <a>Evaluation</a>, we recommend two possible formats,
either comprehensive or comparative.
        </p>
        <p>
A comprehensive <a>Evaluation</a> applies a single set of criteria to just one
Method. This set is chosen by the <a>Evaluator</a>; it need not be all
possible criteria, but it is all relevant criteria as judged by the
<a>Evaluator</a>. This is the type of <a>Evaluation Report</a> we include in
<a href="#"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
A comparative <a>Evaluation</a> includes multiple Methods in the same table to
easily compare and contrast two or more different Methods. This may include
any number of criteria. These are the type of reports we use as examples
throughout the criteria list.
        </p>
        <p>
In addition to the selected criteria, we recommend each report specify
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
The Method(s) being evaluated
          </li>
          <li>
A link to the Method specification
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>Evaluator</a>(s)
          </li>
          <li>
The date of the <a>Evaluation</a>
          </li>
          <li>
A description of the use case(s) for which the Method is being evaluated
          </li>
          <li>
The rubric used for the <a>Evaluation</a>, along with reference to the
specific version.
          </li>
          <li>
Optionally, a URL for retrieving the report.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
An example comprehensive report header can be found in <a href="#"></a>. An
example comparative report header can be found in
<a href="#comparative-evaluation-report-header"></a>.
        </p>
      </section> <!-- evaluation -->

      <section>
        <h3>Categories of criteria</h3>
        <p>
We have grouped our criteria into five categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
Rulemaking
          </li>
          <li>
Operations
          </li>
          <li>
Enforcement
          </li>
          <li>
Alternatives
          </li>
          <li>
Adoption
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
<a>Evaluator</a>s should consider criteria from all five groups, as best fits
your use cases. The first three are about how a given Method is governed:
Rulemaking, Operations, and Enforcement. The latter two address issues of
lock-in and accessibility: Alternatives and Adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
A few notes about governance. Our approach parallels the same breakdown in
authority embodied in the United States Constitution.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Rulemaking</strong> addresses who makes the rules and how. (This is
the legislative branch in the US.)
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Operations</strong> addresses how those rules are executed and how
everyone knows that they are carried out. (This is the executive branch in the
US.)
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Enforcement</strong> addresses how we find and respond to rule
breaking. (This is the judicial branch in the US.)
        </p>
        <p>
This mental model is key to understanding the criteria of each section as well
as why we included some criteria and not others.
        </p>
        <p>
The sections on Alternatives and Adoption were created because we identified
decentralization factors that have nothing to do with governance. As an
example, a completely open system of formal "decentralized" governance could
be <em>de facto</em> centralized because it is the only available option. If
there is only one wallet you can use for a given Method, that may
be unacceptably centralized for a given use. On the other hand, if that wallet
is already ubiquitous in the use cases that matter, this centralizing factor
may not be as relevant given its accessibility by intended users. Similarly,
some use cases would be dramatically limited if there were only one relying
party who is willing to accept DIDs of a given Method. If a theoretical
did:facebook Method were only accepted by Facebook (because no other services were
willing to use it) that would affect its centralization, even if it were possible
by design for any service to do so. The criteria in Alternatives and Adoption
sections attempt to evaluate these factors.
        </p>
      </section> <!-- categories -->

      <section>
        <h3>The architecture</h3>
        <p>
​When evaluating the governance of DID Methods, three potentially independent
layers should be considered: the specification, the network, and the registry.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
The <strong>specification</strong> is the governing document for the Method
that outlines how that particular Method implements the required and any
optional components of the DID Core specification [[DID-CORE]].
          </li>
          <li>
The <strong>network</strong> is the underlying communications layer, i.e., how
users of the Method communicate with others to invoke the operations of the
Method.
          </li>
          <li>
The <strong>registry</strong> is a given instance of recorded state changes,
managed according to the specification, using the communications channel.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
For Rulemaking, the criteria should be evaluated against all three of the
above layers.
        </p>
        <p>
For Operations, the criteria should be evaluated against the network and the
registry. The specification is taken as a given (it is the core output of
Rulemaking).
        </p>
        <p>
For Adoption, the criteria should be evaluated for each major software
component: wallet, resolver, and registry.
        </p>
        <p>
For Alternatives, the criteria should be evaluated against the particular DID
Method.
        </p>
        <p>
For the examples in the rest of this document we refer to a set of Methods
that are familiar to the authors and exhibit interesting characteristics for
<a>Evaluation</a>. These are listed in the "Comparative Evaluation Report
Header" table below.

Anyone can participate in an open, fair process where all participants have
equal opportunity to be heard and influence decisions.
              </li>
              <li>
Anyone can comment and contribute to open debate, but decisions are ultimately
made by a closed group.

              <li>
Debate is restricted to a selected but known group.

Governance determines how the rules of the underlying network are set and
maintained. The more parties that are able to contribute to governance debates,
the more decentralized the governance.

Is the governing authority for the DID Method innately centralized? Is the
Method governed by a single entity, who could make arbitrary changes to the
governance? Or is it governed by a closed set of parties, without fully open
access? Or is there a legitimate effort to open the decision making process
to multiple, competing and cooperating parties?

The underlying financial goals of DID Method creators may affect the
centralization of their Method. If the goal of a Method is to enhance or
support a certain group, then there may be centralization focused on that
group and their interests. In the most centralized extreme, a Method may be
created explicitly to establish a monopoly market that it can extract rent
from. The opposite extreme is a Method created explicitly for the public good.

Governance takes resources, which can limit the ability of interested parties
to influence rulemaking. Generally, the more expensive it is to participate,
the more governance centralizes to those parties most able to make the
investment.

Permissioned operation impacts the availability of the network to various

Similar to Governance, financial accountability reflects the integrity and
sustainability of the DID registry. The more open, transparent, and accountable
the system, the greater the confidence a DID controller may have that it will
remain stable and operational, and therefore continue to provide service.

Some implementations of some wallets can work with some resolvers,

            <p>
The ability to communicate with different (ideally all) resolvers and
registries significantly increases the applicability of a decentralized
identity layer / usability of a given wallet. Vice versa, limited capability
to work with other Methods and registries restrict usage.

locally or processed ephemerally via communications.

            <p>
Whether or not one can resolve a DID directly on a resource-constrained device
affects the granularity at which smaller devices can be part of the ecosystem.
If small edge devices, such as a smart watch, smart speaker, or even a mobile
phone, are incapable of directly resolving a DID of the DID Method, then the
method will lead to cloud-based services like blockchain explorer APIs, which
themselves become a point of centralization. Many find this option an
acceptable engineering trade-off. Others would prefer solutions that allow
even the smallest devices to be fully capable of resolving DIDs in an
authoritative manner.

Being able to create a DID in constrained situations enables certain types of
decentralized applications that otherwise are not possible. On the edge, many
devices rely on gateways to manage compute-, memory-, and bandwidth- intensive
tasks. For example, while a smart lightbulb might use ZigBee or 6LowPAN, it
will typically use a hub to connect to the Internet, even for access from
devices within the local IP network. The more resources it takes for small
devices to participate in registration, the greater the percentage of those
that will need to rely on centralizing factors like hubs and gateways.

Different Methods enable different scopes in which a DID might be considered
usable or valid. For example, peer DIDs are only usable between the two peers
who share unique DIDs with each other; other parties are unable to resolve the
DID, find the DID Document, or use its information to establish secure
interactions. In contrast, BTCR records all DIDs on a public ledger, meaning
that all DIDs are fundamentally accessible to any party who might receive the
DID. Contextual DIDs are a middle ground that allow a set of parties to use
DIDs, while those outside that group cannot meaningfully do so. Finally,
central DIDs use the DID syntax and DID Documents to establish secure
communications, but authority to use these DIDs resides with the central party,
who may revoke that ability at their discretion.

Trustlessness is a prerequisite of a decentralized system. If you have to
trust the source of a DID Document (i.e., if you can't verify
cryptographically a DID Document that is returned from resolution), then you
are at the mercy of a potentially centralized authority. If, instead you have
a cryptographic audit trail, then the current state of a DID cannot be
compromised by an intermediary or central party.

        <h3>Enforcement</h3>
        <p>
The matter of enforcement is a tricky question, one that the authors did not
have sufficient time to explore and resolve. Although we are forced to leave
this section for future collaboration, we want to share some of our insights.
        </p>
        <p>
In state-level governance, enforcement is an operational matter for the police
and a judgmental matter for the courts. In other words, the police and the
courts constitute the enforcement powers of governance.
        </p>
        <p>
For distributed systems, especially those like Bitcoin and Ethereum,
enforcement is a function of both social and technical functions.
        </p>
        <p>
Technical enforcement could include such notions as which cryptography is used
to ensure proper authentication of transactions or the details of a consensus
mechanism such as proof of work (POW) or proof of stake (POS). Should a given
cryptographic technique prove to be compromised, that would affect the ability
of the system to enforce its own rules, making the specific cryptography used
by a given Method a significant factor in evaluating the suitability of a
given Method. Further, understanding the decentralized nature of a given POW
or POS mechanism requires an <a>Evaluation</a> of both the means for executing
the mechanism as well as a profile of those parties who could potentially
influence or even undermine that mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
Social enforcement mechanisms rely on community or institutions. For Methods
that have explicit governing bodies, like did:sov, presumably enforcement is a
matter under their jurisdiction. Nodes on the network that operate outside the
guidelines of the governing bodies can presumably have permission revoked as a
means of enforcement. Methods that do not have formal governing bodies may,
nevertheless, have a strong enough community to correct violations, as Ethereum
did in response to the
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists">DAO hack</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Finally, all Methods operate in (and across) one or more geographic
jurisdictions, each with potentially distinct laws and mechanisms of
enforcement. Identifying the potential enforcement mechanisms that
<em>could</em> apply to the Method, to those using a Method, or to the
operators of a Method, is almost certainly going to be relevant to certain
<a>Evaluator</a>s. We have already seen GDPR and various US laws being applied
based on where different servers are physically located, with lawsuits brought
against server operators. It is inevitable that similar actions will eventually
be brought against DID Method operators at various levels.
        </p>
        <p>
In short, understanding the process for identifying violations and enforcing
the rules as set by the rulemakers is vital to a complete Evaluation of the
decentralization of a DID Method. We regret that we were not able to sufficiently
explore these issues for this rubric and we look forward to working with
subsequent collaborators to flesh out criteria that can provide suitable
guidance for enforcement criteria.

A DID method that requires implementations to support something weak (e.g.,
1024-bit RSA) is guaranteeing that its users will cooperate by default with
encryption that's relatively easy to crack, with hashing that's not adequately
collision-resistant, etc.

Experts generally consider the system very secure, and this opinion is
reinforced by a track record of secure production use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
The theoretical security of the system looks excellent, and no known attacks
or substantive criticisms are unaddressed. However, limited review or limited
experience informs the opinion.
                        </li>
                        <li>
Credible reports of vulnerabilities or design shortcomings have not been addressed.

Identifier entropy is directly derived from inception keys. Initial
pre-rotation preserves this quality.
                        </li>
                        <li>
Identifiers are assigned by a VDR rather than chosen by users. The VDR uses
a cryptographically robust RNG. This creates a chain of custody that's as
strong as the VDR's integrity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
Identifiers are related to inception keys with some caveats, or they are
assigned by a VDR using an algorithm that has vulnerabilities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
Identifiers are arbitrary. They have no chain of custody before they are
registered on a VDR. DID squatting is possible.

Every evolution of state is recorded, accessible, and linked appropriately
to its predecessor. Arbitrary versions can be queried and proved correct,
and they have a reasonably useful timestamp.

Adequate evidence of proper evolution exists, and a forensic analysis
could prove correctness. However, it's not exposed for consumption of
ordinary resolvers, it lacks supporting metadata, or it's exposed in
a very suboptimal way.

No evidence of proper evolution exists; the users have to trust the
system's assertion that current state resulted from something appropriate.

It's possible to tamper with systems that don't actively prove the
correctness of their current state. Such tampering is not easy to
discover.

Rich diffuse control mechanisms are a first-class feature, and anyone who
resolves a DID can see whether they are in use so confidence is increased.
This may include device revocation (where keys must be exercised on a
particular device to be valid).
                        </li>
                        <li>
Some diffuse control is possible but has important deficits in
documentation, maturity, or visibility.
                        </li>
                        <li>
Multiple parties can exercise control independently. Diffuse control
is possible outside the system (e.g., using Shamir secret sharing to
reconstitute a single key before updating a DID document). It's not
possible to know whether such mechanisms are in use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Only a single party can exercise control at a time.

                        Diffuse trust makes hacking harder and recovery more robust (but maybe more complex).

          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          <p>
When DIDs are used as identifiers for people, it becomes important to
consider what tools a DID method offers to operate at different levels
of privacy. Use cases that focus on IoT or institutions may not feel
that this dimension is especially important (though institutional
privacy may sometimes be desirable).
          </p>

          <p>
Privacy tends to surface some interesting tradeoffs. For example, DID
methods that score very high in the "transparency" dimension may score
low in privacy, and vice versa.

Restricting the audience for a DID is a way to discourage crawling
and secondary, possibly abusive publication. However, no mechanism
can completely prevent this; creating disincentives, accountability,
and/or costs that encourage the DID owner's wishes to be respected
is the best we can hope for.

Each DID is entirely isolated; there is no practical way to infer
relationships of common control between them.
                      </li>
                      <li>
It may be possible to infer relationships of common control based on
timing and the IP address of clients, but not based on data persisted
in the VDR itself. Inference is expensive or impractical.
                      </li>

It is possible to infer relationships based on data persisted in the

The natural and default behavior is to create a new DID in each new
context, and there is no meaningful incentive to do otherwise.
                      </li>
                      <li>
It is possible to create and manage numerous DIDs, but the latency,
complexity, or monetary expense of doing so results in modest
pressure to reuse a DID.

                      <li>
                          Each DID is expensive in at least one important dimension. Incentives to reuse are strong.

People will often trade away privacy for a low price or ease of use.
Methods that encourage this tradeoff are less optimal from a privacy
perspective, even if their privacy features are theoretically reasonable.

of them turned out to be a good fit, often because they were simply not related
to decentralization. They were useful criteria for evaluating a DID Method,
but we specifically limited ourselves to ONLY consider those criteria that
specifically capture some notion of decentralization or its related benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
We've included a list of additional considered criteria in <a href="#possible-additional-criteria"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Maturity was one of those categories of criteria that we liked, but just
wasn't related to how decentralized a Method is. We considered the maturity of
the specification, such as how long it has been published. We considered the
organizational maturity of the lead proponents of the Method: is this Method
backed by a major player that has been around a while or is its only advocate
a small startup? We even considered the operational maturity of the Method:
how long had the Method been live, in production?
        </p>
        <p>
These are all excellent questions to ask when considering supporting, adopting,
or contributing to a particular DID Method, but they do not capture
anything about how decentralized a Method is. A system simply doesn't become
more or less centralized just because it is around a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
What can happen over time is that a given Method might improve in its adoption
or diversity, as more institutions, users, and platforms add support in
various ways, and these aspects of a Method can shift how decentralized a
Method might be, but maturity itself does NOT affect
centralization.
        </p>
        <p>
The authors had similar discussions considering security, privacy, and
reliability criteria. All of these are important, but not directly related to
the question of decentralization. While decentralization can improve
reliability, it can also undermine it if done poorly. Similarly, security and
privacy don't necessarily impact decentrality and vice-versa.
        </p>
        <p>
We encourage everyone using this rubric to consider it as one tool for
evaluating only the decentralization aspect of DID Methods. Other
<a>Evaluations</a> will also be necessary to make a fully informed decision
about adopting, supporting, or contributing to any given Method.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
This Rubric for Decentralization of DID Methods provides one framework for
evaluating how "decentralized" a given DID Method is. It offers a set of
criteria which can be used selectively by <a>Evaluator</a>s to better
understand and document their considerations when deciding to support or adopt
a given DID Method.
        </p>
        <p>
We look forward to feedback and improvements on this document and will be
proposing it as the foundation for further development in the Decentralized
Identifier Working Group (DID WG) of the World Wide Web Consortium. Today,
comments are welcome in the Rebooting Web of Trust repository in which this
document is published. Our intention is to move this conversation to the DID
WG, should the group accept this contribution as a starting point for future
work.
